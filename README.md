When you want to create a Google Apps Script project, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Google Drive.
2. Click on "New" in the top left corner.
3. Hover over "More" and select "Google Apps Script".
4. This will open a new script editor where you can write your code.
5. You can save your script by clicking on "File" and then "Save".
6. You can also create a new script by clicking on the "+" icon next to "Files" in the left sidebar.
7. To run your script, click on the play button (▶️) in the toolbar.
8. I already setup a trigger in each project to run the script. You can modify Trigger.gs for your needs.
9. You need to run first function in Trigger.gs to setup the trigger.
10. When you run the function, it will ask for permissions. You need to allow the permissions for the script to run.
